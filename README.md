Use this project skeleton as a starting point for structuring your app. Things to note
* Sequelize configuration has not yet been added -- you will need to set that up yourself
* You may find yourself wanting to use javascript -- js files can be added in `public/javascripts` and should be appended to the Pug templates as needed
* CSS files can go in `public/stylesheets` and also will need to be added to Pug templates
